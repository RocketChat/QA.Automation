# QA.Automation
**Title**: QA.Automation
**OverView**: It consists of automated end to end Regression test scripts for all the basic functionalities in 
Rocket.chat, written in Selenium webdriver with Python. The purpose is to ensure that the entire system 
(not just a selected component) works flawlessly after any code change. The test scripts allows cross browser testing
and all the test cases can be executed on most popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE. The project also
supports running Selenium Webdriver tests with Python on BrowserStack. The test reports can be generated with
HTML and Allure.
